## About

The main goal of this project was to implement a web application using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for Lech PoznaÅ„ football team fans through which they can predict their favourite team match results and compete with each other by collecting points for correct bets. All the results, points and bets are stored in the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) realtime database.

In order to join the game you have to create an account with a unique username and verified email or log in by connecting your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account to the app. Additionally, a test account was also added through which you can check out limited functionality of the app without creating your own one:

```
email: test@mailinator.com
password: test123
```

The project runs online here: [lech-typer.web.app](https://lech-typer.web.app/)
